# The whole `app` directory is the docroot, sources included, and the sources
# stay unreachable because docker/nginx/default.conf refuses /js/ and /css/ —
# the shell loads nothing from them. Copying the directory rather than a curated
# list of the running files is what lets `docker-compose.override.yml` mount the
# working tree over this path in development and see the same layout.
#
# `npm run build` above has already written app/dist: the content-hashed assets
# and the built shell at app/dist/index.html, which is what `/` resolves to.
COPY --from=build /app/app /usr/share/nginx/html
# The config itself is NOT parsed at build time: `fastcgi_pass php:9000` makes
# nginx resolve a name that only exists on the compose network, so `nginx -t`
# here fails with `host not found in upstream "php"` and can never pass. The real
# check runs where the name resolves — `docker compose run --rm --entrypoint
# nginx web -t`, with the php service attached — and is step one of the
# container check in PLAYBOOK §7. It is not optional and it is not covered by
# any test: an unquoted `{8}` quantifier in a `location ~` is a syntax error to
# nginx and an ordinary string to a test that reads the file, and
# docker-router.php implements the same cache policy in PHP, so it never
# exercises nginx's parser. That combination shipped: the container crash-looped
# on `unknown directive "8}\.(?:js|css)$"` with every test green.
